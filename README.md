### HD Texture Mod for Dissidia 012 on the PSP v0.02

This project aims to completely retexture Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy for the PSP. 

The original game was designed to be viewed on a small 480 x 272 PSP display, which is fine for the time, but low-res and blurry on modern display sizes. The current aim is to replace all textures in the game<sup>1</sup> with new hand-made textures that scale nicely to 1080p.

Originally, the project was going to be a solo undertaking as I spent most of this year unemployed. However, once it finally started gaining steam, I found a very demanding job that leaves me far less free time.

The philosophy behind this project is to make as much as possible by hand. Quick and dirty upscales have been done before, but I want this replacement to be THE texture pack for Dissidia 012. Any upscaling that is done is then edited by hand to remove any kind of artifacts to look as clean as possible.


<sup>1: Some text uses some kind of dynamically-changing text. There may be a way to fix it, but I'm not sure.

Long-term goals include finding a solution for the system font issue and maybe a way to reduce the overall size of the battle UI through hacking. Both of these things are beyond my current abilities, however.


# Directions for installation (USA version of the game only):
<sup>Note: These directions assume that you have PPSSPP installed and a valid USA ROM of the game. You can find instructions on how to rip the game from your own copy online</sup>
1. Transfer all files to: PPSSPP\memstick\PSP\TEXTURES\ULUS10566
2. Open PPSSPP and Click on Settings > Tools > Developer Tools and make sure "Replace textures" is checked.
3. Load the game and ensure the textures are being replaced. If you're not sure, repeat step 2 and compare.
